# 🎨 Color Recognition Using OpenCV

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect the color at the center point of each frame in a video.  
The program analyzes the RGB values of that pixel and classifies it into a common color name like "Red", "Green", "Blue", etc.

Instead of using a live camera, we used a pre-recorded video (`colors.mp4`) containing different colors.
